    <h2> When you start the search for workout spaces, you’ll encounter two main types – fitness clubs and gyms. But which is best?</h2>
           
  <br> <p>For some, the most daunting part of going to a regular gym is being there and having to workout on your own. Going alone in the gym needs a huge amount of not only confidence but also motivation to really push yourself to go to the limit. With a fitness club, there are set daily and weekly classes that members can sign up to. This way, they don’t have to workout alone. From spin and yoga to Zumba and circuits, you’ll be sure to find a class you want to participate in. There, you'll feel as part of a group who want to get fit and be active. And the best part is they’re usually included in the membership fee.</p></div>

  <br> <p>As we’ve said, if you lack confidence in your own ability at the gym it can really be an off-putting factor. But with a fitness club, you don’t have to feel intimidated if you don’t really know what you’re doing in the gym, thanks to personal trainers. A member of the club’s staff can talk you through all the equipment and provide you with training plans so you can get exactly what you want out of your gym workouts. Plus you’ll have an experienced and knowledgeable figure to support and motivate you through your session.</p></div>

  <br> <p>You’d have to search far and wide to find a regular gym with a pool. Away from the running machines and dumbells, swimming is an effective exercise for getting trim. An hour’s worth of swimming can burn 500 calories, as well help tone your abdominal muscles, glutes, quads and obliques. This low-impact exercise works your body in a different way to cardio and weights, meaning the chances of injury are reduced and flexibility can be increased.</p></div>
